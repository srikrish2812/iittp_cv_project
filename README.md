IITTP CV Project 
EE19B030, CS19B015

1. In this project, we developed and trained two deep learning models on satellite image dataset from kaggle.
2. First model is a regular CNN based model that has 17 layers and uses cross-entropy loss function for learning the weights/kernels. (RegNet17 model)
3. Second model is based on the residual architecture added to conventional CNNs. This model too has 17 layers and uses cross-entropy loss function for learning the weights/kernels. (ResNet17 model)
4. Finally, both the models were compared for speed and accuracy.
5. Although RegNet17 is more accurate but ResNet17 has low-inference time which is vital for real-time object classification.
